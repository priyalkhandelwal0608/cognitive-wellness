#  Cognitive Wellness AI Companion

A machine learning-powered web application designed to enhance mental clarity and productivity. By analyzing physiological signals and user sentiment, the system classifies cognitive states (e.g., *Stressed, Fatigued, Focused*) and provides personalized micro-activity recommendations.

##  Key Features

* **Multimodal Analysis:** Integrates text-based mood/thoughts with physical data (Step Count & Heart Rate).
* **State Classification:** Uses a hybrid Rule-based + ML classifier to identify 50+ unique cognitive/emotional states.
* **Intelligent Recommendations:** Powered by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) engine that adapts to user feedback over time.
* **Data-Driven Insights:** Includes an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) suite for visualizing wellness trends.
* **Modern UI:** Responsive dashboard built with Flask, HTML5, and CSS3.
